Idk I like the way this config looks.

Terminal = alacritty

File Manager = thunar

Menu = bemenu (bemenu-run -b)

Bar = waybar (with a power button)

Notifications = swaync

If you wanna "install" this just: 
Back up your previous config, "git clone" this repo, "cp -r" all of this to .config, log out and log back in. It should work.
